  John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose
   entrepreneurial attentions included japanning and papier-mâché;
   he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer,
   not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this
    very day, bears his name.

  <p>
  Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near
  Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in
  Birmingham. Baskerville printed works for the University of
  Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio
  bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin
  Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of
  Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United
  States, where they were adopted for most federal government
  publishing.
  </p>

  <p>
  Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing,
  paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced
  a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type.
  He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding
  wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.

  “Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became
  insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I
  formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared,
  and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what
  I conceived to be their true proportion.”

  The Typeface

  <p>
  Baskerville is a Transitional serif typeface designed by John
  Baskerville in 1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces
  of William Caslon, and the modern styles of Giambattista
  Bodoni and Firmin Didot.
  </p>

  <p>
  The typeface is the result of Baskerville’s intent to improve
  upon the types of William Caslon. He increased the contrast
  between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and
  more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded letters to a more
  vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in
  shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes
  created a greater consistency in size and form.
  </p>

  <p>
  Baskerville’s work was criticised by jealous competitors and soon
  fell out of favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals
  of Baskerville have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and
  other type foundries. Émigré released a popular revival of the
  typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for Baskerville’s wife,
  Sarah Eaves. Baskerville represents the peak of Transitional
  type face design and bridges the gap between Old Style and Modern
  type design.

  Mrs Eaves
  </h3>

  />

  <p>
  Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became
  John Baskerville’s wife. As Baskerville was setting up his
  printing and type business, Mrs. Eaves moved in with him as a
  live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his wife after the
  death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves. Mrs Eaves is a revival
  of the types of English printer and punchcutter John Baskerville,
  and is related to contemporary Baskerville typefaces.
  </p>

  <p>
  Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré,
  has a near vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model.
  Identifying characters, similar to Baskerville’s types, are the
  lowercase g with its open lower counter and swash-like ear.
  Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a flowing swash-like
  tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there is
  no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W;
  and the uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.
